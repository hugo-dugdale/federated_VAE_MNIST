# Federated VAE MNIST

This project examines the feasibility of training a Variational Autoencoder in a federated manner to reconstruct and generate [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist) data. All model training and evaluation can be found in `federated_VAE.ipynb`. Relevant output figures can be found in the `figures` directory.
